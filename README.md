* Star Rating: Allows users to rate services from "Bad" to "Good".
* Experience Rating: Provides a scale (1â€“5) for overall experience.
* Checklist: Collects detailed information about what went wrong.
* Font Choice: The design uses a clean sans-serif font for a modern and professional look.

## Technologies Used
